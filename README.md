# Elevator-Simulation
This is an elevator-simulation program builded in Qt5. Contain door control and elevator up-down control. Since I'm using win32 api in it, the MSVC should be choice for build. For now, a small bug is still exists in it which is always caused by nearest out-call panel signal. One more thing, you must click the Starting up button at first when system is ready for starting, otherwise a unexpected error will be happen.
